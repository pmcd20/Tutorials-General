JWT JSON WEB TOKEN

Example given is based on tutorial off youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH4GhmTPf68
Do take time to watch this as it will also show connection with Postman and testing your token. 

Using Visaul Studio. integrating with Asp Core 2.1. 
As in the video example. I do not use identiy framework so I leave that part out. 
Instead for this template I say if password is not equal   password: "654321" (this is where you insert your own validation)
